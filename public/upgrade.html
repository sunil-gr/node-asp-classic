                    <h3 style="color: #28a745;">All Features Implemented <span class="status-pill status-confirmed">Complete</span></h3>
                    <p>All identified features and functional gaps from the original <code>asp-classic</code> application have now been successfully migrated and implemented in the new Node.js application. The system now supports customer-specific data isolation and provides a user interface for all core administrative tasks.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #007bff;">Note: Courses and SCORM Packages are Global</h3>
                    <p>In both the original <code>asp-classic</code> application and the new Node.js version, <strong>Courses</strong> and <strong>SCORM Packages</strong> are global entities. They are not customer-specific, but can be referenced by customer-specific catalogs. This matches the original system's logic, where catalogs were filtered by customer, but courses and packages were shared across all customers.</p>

            <h2>Final Conclusion: All Core Features Migrated</h2>
            <p>Based on a thorough analysis of the original <code>asp-classic</code> application and the current state of the <code>node-asp-classic</code> migration, we can confirm that **all core features and business logic from the original system have been successfully implemented** in the new application.</p>
