# node-asp-classic
node-asp-classic is typically a Node.js package or concept that helps bridge the gap between Node.js and Classic ASP (Active Server Pages). Since Classic ASP is a legacy server-side technology based on VBScript or JScript running on Microsoft's IIS, it doesn't natively integrate with Node.js
